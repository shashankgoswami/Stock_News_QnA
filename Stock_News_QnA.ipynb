And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kristin. Kristin Dolan Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we get into the call, I wanted to say that we've been focused on supporting our employees and creative partners in Los Angeles during the recent devastating fires. We're thankful for the heroic efforts of firefighters and first responders and recognize the long term period of recovery and rebuilding that lies ahead for our people and the entire city. I also want to acknowledge the recent passing of our Founder and longtime Chairman, Charles Dolan, a visionary and industry icon who created businesses like Cablevision, HBO, and AMC Networks. Mr. Dolan always took a long range view in business, building companies and shaping industries with a clear strategic vision. We have the privilege and responsibility of continuing that approach today and into the future as we execute on our core strengths and advantages and navigate the changing world of media. Now to our results. As we look back on the fourth quarter and full year 2024, I'm encouraged by our progress. Patrick will report on our financial results and outlook in greater detail, but I'm pleased to report that even in this uncertain and shifting environment, we achieved our full year guidance for 2024. This includes consolidated revenue of $2,4 million, consolidated AOI of $563 million and most importantly, free cash flow of $331 million. Free cash flow generation has been strong and today we are increasing our outlook to approximately $550 million of cumulative free cash flow over the '24, '25 period. At a time when all media companies are facing challenges, our size, nimbleness and independence allow us to move quickly to create new opportunities for ourselves and for our partners. Our innovative mentality is driving our approach to content creation, distribution, advertising and new partnerships. This freedom and ability to take a more imaginative approach to our business played out in a number of ways over the past year. We ended 2023 with an unconventional experiment to put some of our shows on the Mac streaming service, where they quickly became top titles. In 2024, we built on this success with an expansive branded licensing agreement with Netflix that featured prior seasons of more than a dozen of our shows, including some of our most important franchises. We believed exposure on this massive platform would boost viewer awareness and interest in our titles and that's exactly what happens. The exclusive availability of current seasons on AMC plus drove viewership and acquisition on our own platform. The Walking Dead: The Once You Live was added to Netflix last month and appeared on the platform's US top 10 list the following day and remained there for weeks, rising as high as number two, ahead of Squid Game and other titles. As we prepare for the return of The US Streaming rights to the original The Walking Dead series in less than two years, it's great to see continued strong interest in this very active and vibrant universe. Our partnership and bundling activity continued in the fourth quarter. We launched a two month content exchange with MGM Plus to promote sampling and drive subscriptions on our respective platforms. Subscribers on both sides of the exchange reacted positively. We saw double digit gains in engagement and acquisition on AMC plus led by the sci-fi horror series from and The Walking Dead Daryl Dixon was a top performer for MGM Plus spending multiple weeks in its top 10 list and peaking at number two. We expanded access to the AMC-plus and STARS bundle by making it available through VIZIO. We offered new bundles through Verizon and brought AMC plus to platforms like Philo with a very positive consumer response. These arrangements helped drive healthy streaming subscriber additions in the fourth quarter. They also underscore the strength of our AMC Studios IP and ability to partner and reach viewers in new ways. As audiences continue to fragment, our number one goal as a company is to produce and curate great shows and films and make that content as easy as possible for viewers to find in a very crowded and noisy world. This strategy requires management of our own platforms and strong relationships with our distribution partners. In 2024, we renewed agreements representing about half of our US Linear footprint, including multiyear deals with Charter, Cox, Verizon and Cable One, among others. And a reminder that our Charter deal will make AMC plus available at no additional cost to all Spectrum customers who receive AMC as part of their TV package. This is in keeping with Charter's broader strategy to bundle streaming value into its video service and will significantly expand the universe of people who have access to AMC plus. In the last twenty four months, we renewed the vast majority of our Canadian distribution footprint with agreements that include easy access to AMC plus for our partners video and broadband customers. We also saw a significant expansion of our fast channel distribution with major launches on platforms like Roku and Prime Video, and we closed a long term renewal with Amazon Prime Video channels for the distribution of our streaming services. We kicked off our 2025, 2026 up front last week, hosting some of our most important longstanding commercial partners at an event spotlighting our technological leadership in advertising. Building upon previous advances in addressable and programmatic buying through our Audience plus platform, we unveiled a groundbreaking attribution product called AMCN Outcomes. We now give our advertising partners real time insights into purchasing decisions that are driven by consumers' exposure to our partners' marketing messages, another meaningful first for AMC Networks. And later this year, as previously announced, we will launch an ad supported version of our popular Shutter streaming service. Let me share a few programming highlights across our linear networks, targeted streaming services and film business. The fourth quarter included our two biggest annual programming events on AMC and AMC plus Fear Fest and Best Christmas Ever. On linear TV, AMC finished the quarter as a top 10 entertainment network with adults 25 to 54 with Fear Fest and Best Christmas Ever driving the network to its highest rated months of the year in October and December. BCE also attracted a record number of sponsors and advertising partners this year. On streaming, Fear Fest drove AMC plus to record movie viewership with best Christmas ever also showing double-digit year-over-year growth in film viewership. We TV remains the number one entertainment network on Friday nights among women in the 25 to 54 demo. In 2024, We TV had two of the top 3 cable originals on Friday nights among women 25 to 54, including Mama June and Love After Lockup, which is also the number one Friday original among black women 25 to 54, followed by The Braxton\\u2019s at number two. The Braxton\\u2019s finished its first season as WE TV's highest rated new reality series in more than three years. BBC America, which we now fully own, just premiered the most recent BBC Natural History tentpole series, the stunning Planet Earth Asia, again narrated by Sir David Attenborough. We are excited to kick off 2025 with a robust slate of highly anticipated new original programming, including the second season of Anne Rice's Mayfair Witches and the highly anticipated third season of Dark Winds exclusively on AMC and AMC-plus. We are excited for the return of Dark Winds on March 9 after the series\\u2019 first two seasons spent an uninterrupted month on the Netflix top 10 list last summer. This year we'll see the return of The Walking Dead: Dead City, a thrilling new series called Nautilus, the third season of The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon set in Spain, and a new series in our growing Anne Rice Immortal universe called Anne Rice's Tallamasqua: The Secret Order. Our targeted streaming services continue to delight viewers with the depth of content in distinct categories that are not available anywhere else. Shudder had an incredible year releasing six of the top 10 horror films of 2024 as ranked by Rotten Tomatoes. Acorn TV brought fans another season of Jane Seymour in Harry Wyld, Sharon D. Clark and Inspector Ellis and will premiere a new series called Irish Blood starring Alicia Silverstone later this year. This is a sample of the depth and appeal our targeted streaming services offer as research shows streaming subscribers continue to seek out special and distinctive as opposed to more of the same. IFC Films had a fantastic year. Its diverse slate included critically acclaimed titles like Memoir of a Snail, Ghost Light, The Taste of Things and Late Night with the Devil, which set an opening weekend box office record for the company. I want to congratulate everyone at IFC Films for the recent Oscar nomination for Memoir of a Snail in the Best Animated Feature category. We are all incredibly proud of the film and grateful for this recognition. We've consistently emphasized programming, partnerships and profitability as our key priorities in running this business and moving the company forward. As we look back on our 2024 results and look forward to a productive year ahead, I'd like to also recognize our people. This is not an easy or straightforward time to be working in media, but as I see your progress, I'm thankful for our collective ability to adapt, evolve and lean into the advantages and strengths we bring to this dynamic and changing marketplace. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick for a detailed look at our financial results. Story Continues Patrick O Connell Thank you, Kristin. I'm pleased to report today that 2024 landed right where we said it would. As a nimble and innovative premium programmer, we've maintained focus on what is within our control despite a challenging linear environment. We are proud of the progress we've made over the last two years, including reorienting our business around free cash flow, investing in valuable world class IP and remaining focused on our balance sheet. We achieved our full year guidance for 2024. Consolidated revenue was $2.4 million. On an apples to apples basis, excluding 2023 revenue from 25/7 Media, Silo, the Hulu return of rights and 2024 revenue related to the one time advertising revenue adjustments at AMC and I, consolidated revenue decreased 6%. Consolidated operating loss was $40 million and included impairment and other charges of $400 million and restructuring charges of $49 million. Consolidated adjusted operating income was $563 million and most importantly, we delivered significant year-over-year free cash flow growth with free cash flow of $331 million. For the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue was $599 million. Consolidated operating loss was $254 million and included impairment and other charges of $303 million and restructuring charges of $43 million. Adjusted operating income was $129 million and we generated free cash flow of $38 million. I'll now discuss our segment results. Domestic operations revenues decreased 9% to $2.1 million for the full year and decreased 11% to $520 million for the fourth quarter. Subscription revenue decreased 5% for the full year and 4% for the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to linear subscriber declines resulting in a 13% decline in affiliate revenue for both the year and the quarter. This was partially offset by streaming revenue growth of 7% for the year and 8% for the quarter. We ended the year with 12.4 million streaming subs representing year-over-year increase of 8%. Domestic operations advertising revenue decreased 11% for the year and 12% for the fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower linear ratings and a challenging ad market for entertainment and was partially offset by continued digital growth. Digital advertising revenue, including addressable and revenue from our Fast and Avod offerings, continues to grow at a double digit rate. And in 2024, this digital revenue represented approximately a quarter of our overall domestic operations ad revenue. Content licensing revenue was $277 million for the full year and $67 million for the fourth quarter. There were a couple of items in 2023 that impacted the comparability of our 2024 results, including the final delivery of AMC Studios produced episodes of Silo to Apple and the early return of rights from Hulu, which resulted in $56 million and $20 million of one time revenue in 2023, respectively. Excluding these items, our full year licensing revenue increased 4%. As our library grows every year, we have more SKUs to sell and while some of our bigger ticket shows like Fear the Walking Dead contributed less meaningfully toward 2024 results as compared to 2023, this was more than offset by new business including Netflix, Sky in The UK, and increased licensing volume from our targeted services. Domestic operations AOI was $62 million for the full year and $152 million for the quarter. Margins for both the full year and fourth quarter were 29%. The year-over-year decrease in AOI for the full year was largely driven by continued linear revenue headwinds. For the fourth quarter, the increase in AOI is primarily driven by lower expenses and streaming revenue growth, partly offset by linear revenue headwinds. Moving to our International segment. International revenue included advertising revenue related to retroactive onetime adjustments reported by a third party of $21 million for the full year and $7 million for the fourth quarter. Excluding 25/7 Media, which we divested a year ago, and the onetime adjustments I just mentioned, international revenues decreased 3% for the full year and increased 2% for the quarter. On an Apples-to-Apples basis, advertising revenues grew 16% and 12% for the full year and fourth quarter, respectively. This was largely the result of the strong performance of our AVOD offerings on the ITVX in The UK, as well as increased ratings and growth across our Central and Northern European advertising markets. Subscription revenues declined 11% for the full year and 5% for the quarter. For the full year, the decrease in subscription revenue was attributable to the non-renewal of a distribution agreement in The UK that occurred in the prior year. For the quarter, the decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable FX. Moving to international AOI. Excluding the onetime adjustments to advertising revenue, full year AOI was $45 million with a 15% margin and fourth quarter AOI was $1 million. On to the balance sheet. We ended the year with net debt of $1.6 million and a consolidated net leverage ratio of 2.8 times. We remain focused on our balance sheet and we're pleased with the results of our efforts over the last 24 months. This includes gross debt reduction of approximately [$0.5 million] and the completion of a series of financings that extended our maturity profile, now with no bond maturities until 2029. Additionally, we've maintained a healthy cash position and ended the year with approximately $1 billion in total liquidity. This includes $785 million of cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn $175 million revolver. We appreciate the flexibility and optionality of our meaningful cash balance and continue to expect that our capital structure will present attractive opportunities for us over time. Our capital allocation philosophy remains prudent and opportunistic. First, we look to support the business by creating and acquiring compelling programming that resonates with our audiences, while maintaining healthy levels of cash flow generation. Second, we remain focused on continually improving our balance sheet by reducing gross debt and optimizing our capital structure. Lastly, M&A, share repurchases and dividends remain further down our priority list. Moving on to our outlook for 2025. I'll start with our most important metric, free cash flow. As Kristin mentioned, on the heels of strong cash generation we delivered in 2024, we are pleased to update our outlook today for the two year period ending 2025. We now expect to generate cumulative free cash flow of approximately $550 million by the end of 2025. This implies approximately $220 million of free cash flow for the full year 2025. Our outlook contemplates increased cash interest payments resulting from the recent refinancing activity as well as a year-over-year increase in cash taxes as we lap certain tax benefits recognized in 2024. Looking at revenue for 2025, we expect total consolidated revenue for the full year 2025 to decrease approximately 5% as compared to 2024, implying total revenue of approximately $2.3 million. As it is still early in the year, the geography of certain revenue and expense items may shift as the year unfolds. Notwithstanding that, I'll unpack the current assumptions that underpin our outlook. First, regarding domestic operations subscription revenue, we expect 2025 subscription revenue to be flat as compared to 2024. We anticipate that linear subscriber headwinds will persist and will result in slightly worse year-over-year affiliate revenue growth as compared to 2024. This will be offset by accelerated streaming growth. Streaming revenue growth will be driven by price increases, expanded distribution of our offerings and discretionary marketing investments. As such, we expect streaming revenue growth in the low to mid-teens percent area as compared to 2024. With respect to advertising revenue, as I mentioned earlier, digital advertising revenue growth remains robust and we're now growing off a more meaningful base. Notwithstanding that, the linear ratings environment and entertainment ad marketplace continues to be challenging. Therefore, we expect 2025 domestic advertising revenue to decline approximately 10% as compared to 2024. Content licensing remains an important source of revenue for us and we continue to be innovative, progressive and disciplined regarding this important revenue stream. As you know, licensing revenues are often deal dependent and can be lumpy due to timing or shifting delivery schedules. Today, across the many desirable titles in our library, we anticipate approximately $250 million of domestic operations content licensing revenue for 2025. For AMC Networks International, we expect revenue in the range of $290 million to $300 million for the full year 2025. As I discussed earlier, we recognized $21 million of onetime adjustments that benefited advertising revenue in 2024. For 2025, excluding these 2024 adjustments, we expect year-over-year international advertising revenue growth. Additionally, we anticipate the subscription revenue will decrease year-over-year, largely owed to a recent non-renewal with Movistar in Spain. We expect that this non-renewal will represent a $15 million headwind to both revenue and AOI in the segment. Moving to expenses. For 2025, we expect consolidated technical and operating expenses to increase as compared to 2024, driven by higher non amortization technical and operating expenses, including certain duplicate expenses related to our technology outsourcing transformation. This will be partly offset by year-over-year decrease in programming amortization related to our 2025 slate timing and composition and programming write-offs that occurred in 2024. For SG&A, we anticipate a year-over-year increase in SG&A expense for 2025, primarily related to increased streaming related marketing investments focused on driving retention which we anticipate will drive profitable streaming growth. In terms of consolidated adjusted operating income, while we see strong streaming and digital advertising revenue growth and expect our portfolio of streaming services will contribute to our consolidated AOI in 2025. The dynamics I just discussed, including continued linear revenue headwinds and year-over-year expense growth, remain the primary factors in driving our AOI outlook. As such, we expect consolidated AOI for the full year to be in the range of $400 million to $420 million. Cash programming spend can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. And for 2025, we expect a slight decrease in year-over-year cash programming spend due to the timing of our programming commitments. As Kristen said earlier, we take a long range view of the business and we're managing AMC Networks with a clear strategic plan centered around programming, partnerships and profitability. As we enter our third year since reorienting the business, this strategy continues to animate our market approach. Our commitment to creating high quality content remains at the center of everything we do. As an independent, nimble and innovative premium programmer, we approach the marketplace a bit differently than others, including building out our library of powerful franchises, monetizing our content across an evolving distribution ecosystem and driving profitable outcomes. We'll continue to preserve capital with a focus on our balance sheet and cash flow generation and balance appropriate levels of programming investment against the available monetization opportunities. Operator, please open the line for questions. Question and Answer Session Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Thomas Yeh, Morgan Stanley. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow outlook in the context of your cash spending comments. The $930 million of cash spend you put up, I think, in this year ended up being a little bit lower than the [$1 billion] you guided to and you spoke to further decreases in 2025. How much of that is timing versus just an increased focus on efficiency and your outlook updated in terms of how you see the potential opportunity for putting new content to work in the system? Patrick O Connell Sure, great. Hey, Thomas, this is Patrick. Thanks for the question. Our strategy remains the same, right, which is bouncing investments in our programming with driving profitability in the business. Obviously, programming is our largest expense category. We're extraordinarily focused on maintaining a portfolio of super high quality scripted programming across linear streaming etcetera. We continue to do that even as others have pulled back from the market and frankly the differentiator in many of our affiliate conversations. So the strategy has not changed. In terms of the specifics, free cash, the cash programming spend came in a little bit lighter in 2024 than we had initially guided to. This is us just being prudent. We're able to produce on a per episode basis a little bit better than we expected. We've got some fantastic people internally who are taking it available or taking advantage of all the tools available to produce efficiently. So we've been the beneficiary of that. And we have also instituted a program where we're sharing more content across channels, platforms, etcetera, that's allowed us to sort of program the broader company a bit more efficiently. But we obviously remain committed to similar levels of cash programming spend going forward. So I would say efficiency was kind of the other reason for the B quote unquote in 2024. Slight reductions in volume going forward, but not significant. We're producing at similar volumes going forward into 2025. The slight sort of decrease that I expect in cash programming for 2025 has to do with sort of those two factors, I would say. One, modest reductions in volume, but not anything dramatic. And then two, and you might appreciate this, there is a lag in our receipt of certain tax credit receivables and those are going to there's a bunch of them they're going to hit in 2025. So those net out against our cash programming expenses and that's driving part of the reduction in the year-over-year decline. Kristin Dolan And just wanted to reiterate and we were pretty specific about it in the script that the quality of the content that Dan and team continue to produce is it's very reassuring to see the attention we got on Netflix, the Oscar nod, for memoir and just overall the response that we have and engagement that we have to the shows that we're producing. And we've really been able to capitalize in Wind shows like Daryl Dixon, where we're filming in Spain or in France on tax efficiencies. We have some shows planned in Canada. We do a lot in Ireland. So we're really optimizing without in any way compromising the integrity and the quality of what's coming out of our shop. Okay, understood. That's helpful. And some nice momentum in the streaming subscriber growth continued into 4Q. It sounded like bundled partnerships helped, but also the Netflix licensing deal was a contributor as well. Can you maybe just tease out the balance of the contribution between those two and how we kind of see the outlook being supported in 2025 from a volume perspective in AMC plus and maybe the future of the targeted streaming services? And then if I could just squeeze one last one in that same kind of context. Just a clarification on the guide, is the Charter deal showing up in some allocated form between affiliate and streaming in terms of the subcomponents, Patrick, that you provided? Thank you. Patrick O Connell Yes, sure. Great. Thanks, Thomas. Yes, listen, on the streaming subs, listen, we continue to have pretty good momentum across all of our services. And when you look at it across the entire business, we had sort of the lowest churn or we had year-over-year declines in churn on a consolidated basis across the portfolio. So obviously retaining subscribers kind of helps drive the numbers. We've also, as you pointed out, been the beneficiary of some fantastic kind of bundled arrangements as Kristin has talked about a lot. We are very nimble, very flexible. We love to partner with others. We're highly complementary. We think it adds value into the ecosystem. It's great for consumers. It's obviously great for us in terms of being able to distribute product with a little bit less kind of hard marketing dollars. So those are very efficient go to market channels for us. As we look forward into 2025, we're expecting really healthy streaming revenue growth that will be driven by a lot of price action, but also kind of unit volume as well. So we're really excited about this momentum. And I'd point out for folks that if you unpack the guide, you'll notice that we've called out sort of flat subscription revenue year-over-year. So that implies almost $100 million of incremental streaming revenue here, which is going to essentially offset some of the secular declines in the business. So super excited about that. In terms of the specific geography on the guide in terms of revenue, you should assume that that charter deal is baked into the specific revenue line items that we gave. More to come on, end up with that importantly that deal doesn't kick in until Q1. So we'll have more to say in terms of the details in terms of subscribers, but you should just take the guidance face value at this point. Charter deals baked in. Kristin Dolan And just to add on the streaming equation, the partnerships that we're engaging in for bundles are important, but also our relationships with our wholesalers. So Amazon, Roku, Philo, other folks that we participate with in addition to the traditional MVPDs are really critical and they are great partners in giving us data and insights around our subscribers and our utilization. So we're getting smarter and better at really identifying in a privacy compliant way, who's watching what and how to engage with them in addition to the communications that are coming from their subscription provider. So Amazon is talking to a customer, we know, but then we can supplement that conversation with specific sort of nods and suggestions to keep the engagement level high. And then I'm particularly proud here of the team really learning and taking a page from sort of the cable vision playbook on triple play and retention marketing that we're getting really sophisticated and smarter about retaining customers as opposed to just going after and spending subscriber acquisition money to bring them on board. So we're learning a lot and heavily focused on retention, which obviously will pay for itself in the long run. Operator David Joyce, Seaport Research Partners. Thank you. Could you please provide some more color on what kind of lift in viewership and linear ad revenue that you are interpolating is probably coming from licensing your content to Netflix. And given you did say there's double digit growth of digital advertising, just was wondering what it will take to get that whole segment, including linear, to get closer to matching the Connected TV ad growth? Thanks. Kim Kelleher Sure. David, this is Kim Kelleher. Thanks for your question. I'd just clarify that the Netflix partnership is not ad supported on platform even though our shows are distributed on both their ad tier and on their ad free tier if they are distributed in a no ad way. So there is well, I just want to clarify that one point. But to your next question, I do believe we are making great progress. The innovation we're doing in advertising, which is really focused on three areas. It's to make our inventory more available to buy seamlessly, to use data, as Kristen just talked about, and targeting to make our inventory more valuable. And then last, packaging our inventory in a cross platform way so that marketers can access our full scale of viewership at once regardless of how they watch TV. So we've mentioned on past calls, we've innovated with making our debut with industry first biddable programmatic buying capabilities embedded across our linear networks. We have added AMC plus ad supported inventory to our cross platform solutions, and that's been incredibly well received by the marketplace. We're adding a shutter ad tier, as Patrick just talked about in Q1. So that will add inventory as well. Sorry, I meant to say in fall. And then it's that way we package that inventory, like really delivering full genres to advertisers that are looking for targeted cohorts and audiences, really engaged fan communities, and it's working incredibly well. Most recently, as Kristen talked about in her remarks at the top, we launched Outcomes, our new performance product that's built into our Audience plus insights and data targeting platform, and this allows advertisers to see campaign outcomes and optimize delivery in real time. So what I'm saying is, cumulatively, we are making tracks towards leveling out the differential between the declining linear environment and the growth in our digital environment. It's just going to take a little bit of time. Yes. Appreciate that. What I was looking for, I guess, was how are you interpolating your licensing to Netflix into what kind of incremental viewership you're attracting on your linear properties, like the new seasons of what you've put on to Netflix, for example? Kristin Dolan I think it's not so much, I guess, the direct correlation with linear, but I would say, what we're thrilled about is as we are launching the new seasons of these shows that were on Netflix prior, we're seeing significant increases in AMC plus acquisition based on people watching the earlier seasons on Netflix. So we definitely see a strong correlation between they viewed it on the massive platform that is Netflix and then they're hungry for more, so they come back to us, and purchase AMC Plus to see that latest, which is exactly why we -- it's the Netflix effect that we talked about on the last call and that's definitely has worked really well for us. Understood. And just one final thing, if I could please. On the content licensing, are there specific projects that are being sold to third parties like you did with Silo, Hulu? Or is everything still going to be for your -- before your services, the first? Yes. David, this is Dan McDermott from the Studio side. Currently, we're producing pretty much exclusively for our AMC owned platforms right now. We do have a studio we are able to produce for third parties when it's beneficial to us and it makes financial sense. We do have a lot of interest in our studio content. So we're going to be strategic and opportunistic as we go forward. And when it makes sense and we can generate revenue and it will be accredited to the business, we'll explore those opportunities. -- Patrick O Connell And David, it's Patrick from the finance side. You'll recall the guide last year for 2024 was $225 million of run rate content licensing revenue. That was based on our current level of production. We're at $250 million this year, right? So I just wanted to did that help sort of contextualize the fact that one, we continue to produce that in a very healthy levels and two, the market continues to be extraordinarily receptive to the programming that we're producing. So it's a it was a net growth driver in 2024 and we think it's going to continue to be a tailwind at 2025. Operator Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Nick Seibert for any closing remarks. Nicholas Seibert Thank you all for joining us today. Have a good day. Operator Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.

The FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from offering or paying bribes to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, has been a target of criticism by Trump for over a decade. However, enforcement of the law remained stable during his first administration, with no significant changes in approach or the number of resolved actions. The executive order comes after New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on charges that he allegedly accepted bribes from a Turkish official, including free flights and discounted hotel stays.

            "title: Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Most Profitable Tech Stock to Buy Now?\n",
            "full_text: We recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other most profitable tech stocks to buy now. Profitability remains one of the most sought-after traits in the technology sector, yet it is also one of the most complex. It is shaped by a delicate balance of investment cycles, competition, and market perception. While topline growth often takes center stage—driving valuations and attracting top talent—sustained profitability becomes crucial as industries mature, competition peaks, and new investments become necessary for survival. In this ever-evolving landscape, technology companies have mastered the art of balancing revenue expansion with profit growth by diversifying their businesses, building vast customer ecosystems, and continuously enhancing product experiences. Looking ahead, earnings growth will take on an even greater role in determining valuations, particularly as the breakneck pace of growth begins to slow. Investors will increasingly focus on sustainable profitability rather than just rapid growth. In a January 2024 article, Rob Haworth, Senior Investment Strategy Director at U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasized that technology companies possess strong earnings growth potential, largely independent of traditional business cycles. He explained: “What is not clear yet is how companies investing in AI as a way to increase efficiencies or monetize services for end users will benefit from these advancements. We’re in a consolidation phase to figure out what revenue growth will be going forward. If AI helps boost productivity, that will support not only current rising stock valuations but individual prosperity as well.” Franklin Templeton’s 2025 Technology Outlook echoes this sentiment, predicting another year of strong growth in the sector. The report notes that the “Magnificent Seven”—a group of leading tech giants—delivered exceptional earnings in 2024, outpacing both the broader market and the tech industry itself. While these companies are expected to maintain strong momentum, The firm anticipates that the rest of the sector may start catching up in 2025. Tech investments are projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reshaping the profitability landscape. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and autonomous systems present both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Some companies will achieve sustainable profit margins through strategic pricing and ecosystem advantages, while others will struggle under the weight of fierce competition and heavy reinvestment costs. For investors and stakeholders, understanding these shifting dynamics is key to navigating the ever-changing tech sector. Story Continues Our Methodology To identify the 10 most profitable stocks, we conducted extensive research on U.S.-listed technology and tech-adjacent companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. Rather than relying solely on absolute net income, we refined our selection criteria by focusing on companies with both an operating margin and net profit margin exceeding 20%. This approach ensures that high-margin firms are not overshadowed by larger corporations with higher overall earnings. After applying these filters, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their trailing twelve-month net income, with the company reporting the highest net income securing the top position. Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Most Profitable Tech Stock to Buy Now? A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) TTM Net Income: $96.2 billion Number of hedge funds: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets innovative products, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The company also offers a range of software and services, such as the iOS and macOS operating systems, iCloud, advertising, payment services, Apple Music, and the App Store. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an operating margin of 32% and a net profit margin of 24%. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s dedication to design, quality, and user experience has established it as a dominant player in the consumer electronics market. The company is increasingly focusing on services and software, which significantly contribute to its revenue. With a large, loyal customer base and an expanding ecosystem, Apple exhibits strong business momentum. The company’s services segment, which includes subscriptions and digital content, is expected to grow significantly, providing a steady revenue stream. As of December 2024, Apple’s installed base of active devices stood at an impressive 2.35 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported steady Q1 2025 results (FY ending September 2025), with sales growth of 4% year-over-year (YoY) which came in line with street expectations, and EPS coming in slightly ahead of expectations. Sales growth was primarily driven by the ‘Services’ segment, where sales rose 14% YoY, while the ‘Product’ segment sales grew 2%. Among products, Mac and iPad sales increased by around 15% each, but iPhone and Wearables sales were down 1%-2%. The company returned over $30 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $3.9 billion in dividends and $23.3 billion through repurchases of 100 million shares. Additionally, it plans to expand Apple Intelligence to new markets and languages in April 2025, which is expected to drive further adoption and enhance the user experience. On January 31, a Morgan Stanley analyst reaffirmed his Overweight rating and maintained a $275 price target for the shares. He predicts a strong launch for the iPhone SE 4, with an estimated 3 million units built in the first quarter of 2025 and a total of 15 million shipments throughout FY 2025. He attributes the anticipated success to the iPhone SE 4’s improved hardware, including a 6.1-inch AMOLED display and A18 Bionic chip, which he believes will support a starting price of $499. Overall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of most profitable tech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

This microcap company with market capitalization of $44.56 million reports 11% year-over-year sales growth in third-quarter 2024, driven by its market-leading First Defense line targeting the $75-million scours prevention market.Capacity expansions support more than $30 million in annual sales, while Re-Tain, nearing FDA approval, aims to disrupt the $2-billion subclinical mastitis market with treatment free of milk/meat restrictions. ATM (at-the-market) offerings increased cash reserves to $3.8 million, aiding growth initiatives. International expansion and market diversification bolster opportunities.However, Re-Tain's 20-year, $50-million regulatory delays strain resources, whereas a low gross margin, rising costs and Tri-Shield inefficiencies weigh on profitability. High customer concentration (77% revenues from two clients), shareholder dilution, and competition from giants like Zoetis and Merck pose ongoing risks.(You can read the full research report on ImmuCell here >>>) Story Continues Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

            "title: Wall Street bullish as cash levels drop to 15-year low: BofA\n",
            "full_text: Wall Street is feeling bullish as Bank of America's global fund manager survey pointing to cash levels having fallen to a 15-year low. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Josh Schafer joins Morning Brief to discuss the latest Bank of America survey, highlighting that fund managers are moving away from the crowded Magnificent Seven trade — the group of tech stocks comprised of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). Instead, managers are now more focused on global equities, gold (GC=F), and small-cap US stocks. This shift could lead to a stock picker’s market with potential risks tied to market leadership and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates.

Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Josh Schafer joins Morning Brief to discuss the latest Bank of America survey, highlighting that fund managers are moving away from the crowded Magnificent Seven trade — the group of tech stocks comprised of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). Instead, managers are now more focused on global equities, gold (GC=F), and small-cap US stocks.

              "    'full_text': 'We recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other most profitable tech stocks to buy now. Profitability remains one of the most sought-after traits in the technology sector, yet it is also one of the most complex. It is shaped by a delicate balance of investment cycles, competition, and market perception. While topline growth often takes center stage—driving valuations and attracting top talent—sustained profitability becomes crucial as industries mature, competition peaks, and new investments become necessary for survival. In this ever-evolving landscape, technology companies have mastered the art of balancing revenue expansion with profit growth by diversifying their businesses, building vast customer ecosystems, and continuously enhancing product experiences. Looking ahead, earnings growth will take on an even greater role in determining valuations, particularly as the breakneck pace of growth begins to slow. Investors will increasingly focus on sustainable profitability rather than just rapid growth. In a January 2024 article, Rob Haworth, Senior Investment Strategy Director at U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasized that technology companies possess strong earnings growth potential, largely independent of traditional business cycles. He explained: “What is not clear yet is how companies investing in AI as a way to increase efficiencies or monetize services for end users will benefit from these advancements. We’re in a consolidation phase to figure out what revenue growth will be going forward. If AI helps boost productivity, that will support not only current rising stock valuations but individual prosperity as well.” Franklin Templeton’s 2025 Technology Outlook echoes this sentiment, predicting another year of strong growth in the sector. The report notes that the “Magnificent Seven”—a group of leading tech giants—delivered exceptional earnings in 2024, outpacing both the broader market and the tech industry itself. While these companies are expected to maintain strong momentum, The firm anticipates that the rest of the sector may start catching up in 2025. Tech investments are projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reshaping the profitability landscape. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and autonomous systems present both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Some companies will achieve sustainable profit margins through strategic pricing and ecosystem advantages, while others will struggle under the weight of fierce competition and heavy reinvestment costs. For investors and stakeholders, understanding these shifting dynamics is key to navigating the ever-changing tech sector. Story Continues Our Methodology To identify the 10 most profitable stocks, we conducted extensive research on U.S.-listed technology and tech-adjacent companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. Rather than relying solely on absolute net income, we refined our selection criteria by focusing on companies with both an operating margin and net profit margin exceeding 20%. This approach ensures that high-margin firms are not overshadowed by larger corporations with higher overall earnings. After applying these filters, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their trailing twelve-month net income, with the company reporting the highest net income securing the top position. Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

(AAPL) the Most Profitable Tech Stock to Buy Now?\\nfull_text: We recently published a list of 10 Most Profitable Tech Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other most profitable tech stocks to buy now. Profitability remains one of the most sought-after traits in the technology sector, yet it is also one of the most complex. It is shaped by a delicate balance of investment cycles, competition, and market perception. While topline growth often takes center stage—driving valuations and attracting top talent—sustained profitability becomes crucial as industries mature, competition peaks, and new investments become necessary for survival. In this ever-evolving landscape, technology companies have mastered the art of balancing revenue expansion with profit growth by diversifying their businesses, building vast customer ecosystems, and continuously enhancing product experiences. Looking ahead, earnings growth will take on an even greater role in determining valuations, particularly as the breakneck pace of growth begins to slow. Investors will increasingly focus on sustainable profitability rather than just rapid growth. In a January 2024 article, Rob Haworth, Senior Investment Strategy Director at U.S. Bank Asset Management, emphasized that technology companies possess strong earnings growth potential, largely independent of traditional business cycles. He explained: “What is not clear yet is how companies investing in AI as a way to increase efficiencies or monetize services for end users will benefit from these advancements. We’re in a consolidation phase to figure out what revenue growth will be going forward. If AI helps boost productivity, that will support not only current rising stock valuations but individual prosperity as well.” Franklin Templeton’s 2025 Technology Outlook echoes this sentiment, predicting another year of strong growth in the sector. The report notes that the “Magnificent Seven”—a group of leading tech giants—delivered exceptional earnings in 2024, outpacing both the broader market and the tech industry itself. While these companies are expected to maintain strong momentum, The firm anticipates that the rest of the sector may start catching up in 2025. Tech investments are projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, reshaping the profitability landscape. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and autonomous systems present both immense opportunities and significant challenges. Some companies will achieve sustainable profit margins through strategic pricing and ecosystem advantages, while others will struggle under the weight of fierce competition and heavy reinvestment costs. For investors and stakeholders, understanding these shifting dynamics is key to navigating the ever-changing tech sector. Story Continues Our Methodology To identify the 10 most profitable stocks, we conducted extensive research on U.S.-listed technology and tech-adjacent companies with a market capitalization of at least $2 billion. Rather than relying solely on absolute net income, we refined our selection criteria by focusing on companies with both an operating margin and net profit margin exceeding 20%. This approach ensures that high-margin firms are not overshadowed by larger corporations with higher overall earnings. After applying these filters, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their trailing twelve-month net income, with the company reporting the highest net income securing the top position. Note: All pricing data is as of market close on February 14. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\\xa0(see more details here). Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Most Profitable Tech Stock to Buy Now? A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) TTM Net Income: $96.2 billion Number of hedge funds: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and markets innovative products, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. The company also offers a range of software and services, such as the iOS and macOS operating systems, iCloud, advertising, payment services, Apple Music, and the App Store. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an operating margin of 32% and a net profit margin of 24%. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s dedication to design, quality, and user experience has established it as a dominant player in the consumer electronics market. The company is increasingly focusing on services and software, which significantly contribute to its revenue. With a large, loyal customer base and an expanding ecosystem, Apple exhibits strong business momentum. The company’s services segment, which includes subscriptions and digital content, is expected to grow significantly, providing a steady revenue stream. As of December 2024, Apple’s installed base of active devices stood at an impressive 2.35 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported steady Q1 2025 results (FY ending September 2025), with sales growth of 4% year-over-year (YoY) which came in line with street expectations, and EPS coming in slightly ahead of expectations. Sales growth was primarily driven by the ‘Services’ segment, where sales rose 14% YoY, while the ‘Product’ segment sales grew 2%. Among products, Mac and iPad sales increased by around 15% each, but iPhone and Wearables sales were down 1%-2%. The company returned over $30 billion to shareholders in the quarter, including $3.9 billion in dividends and $23.3 billion through repurchases of 100 million shares. Additionally, it plans to expand Apple Intelligence to new markets and languages in April 2025, which is expected to drive further adoption and enhance the user experience. On January 31, a Morgan Stanley analyst reaffirmed his Overweight rating and maintained a $275 price target for the shares. He predicts a strong launch for the iPhone SE 4, with an estimated 3 million units built in the first quarter of 2025 and a total of 15 million shipments throughout FY 2025. He attributes the anticipated success to the iPhone SE 4’s improved hardware, including a 6.1-inch AMOLED display and A18 Bionic chip, which he believes will support a starting price of $499. Overall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of most profitable tech stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

For the Services segment, It expects a low double-digit growth rate.Introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia will help Apple shares to push higher.

The company\\'s Q4 earnings beat estimates while sales missed the same. Demand for Lilly\\'s popular GLP-1 drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound, remains strong, making them the company\\'s key top-line drivers.In the past two years, Lilly has received approvals for several new drugs like Kisunla, Omvoh and Jaypirca. Its new drugs contributed significantly to its top-line growth in 2024. Lilly is also making rapid pipeline progress in areas like obesity, diabetes and Alzheimer\\'s.However, sales of Mounjaro/Zepbound were disappointing in the second half of 2024 due to slower-than-expected growth, which has raised concerns about moderating demand for the drugs. Declining sales of Trulicity and potential competition in the GLP-1 diabetes/obesity market are some top-line headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here >>>)Shares of Shopify have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the past year (+47.1% vs. +28%).

This microcap company with market capitalization of $44.56 million reports 11% year-over-year sales growth in third-quarter 2024, driven by its market-leading First Defense line targeting the $75-million scours prevention market.Capacity expansions support more than $30 million in annual sales, while Re-Tain, nearing FDA approval, aims to disrupt the $2-billion subclinical mastitis market with treatment free of milk/meat restrictions. ATM (at-the-market) offerings increased cash reserves to $3.8 million, aiding growth initiatives. International expansion and market diversification bolster opportunities.However, Re-Tain\\'s 20-year, $50-million regulatory delays strain resources, whereas a low gross margin, rising costs and Tri-Shield inefficiencies weigh on profitability.

However, persistent inflation and cautious consumer spending are headwinds.(You can read the full research report on Shopify here >>>)ImmuCell\\'s shares have gained +0.8% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - Products industry\\'s gain of +16.7%. This microcap company with market capitalization of $44.56 million reports 11% year-over-year sales growth in third-quarter 2024, driven by its market-leading First Defense line targeting the $75-million scours prevention market.Capacity expansions support more than $30 million in annual sales, while Re-Tain, nearing FDA approval, aims to disrupt the $2-billion subclinical mastitis market with treatment free of milk/meat restrictions. ATM (at-the-market) offerings increased cash reserves to $3.8 million, aiding growth initiatives. International expansion and market diversification bolster opportunities.However, Re-Tain\\'s 20-year, $50-million regulatory delays strain resources, whereas a low gross margin, rising costs and Tri-Shield inefficiencies weigh on profitability. High customer concentration (77% revenues from two clients), shareholder dilution, and competition from giants like Zoetis and Merck pose ongoing risks.(You can read the full research report on ImmuCell here >>>) Story Continues Why Haven\\'t You Looked at Zacks\\' Top Stocks?

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2416472/3-lessons-from-buffetts-apple-stock-sales) 3 Lessons from Buffett\\'s Apple Stock Sales Welcome to Episode #396 of the Value Investor Podcast. (0:30) - How Much Should You Follow The 13-F Filings? (4:10) - Investing Lessons To Learn From Warren Buffett (27:45) - Episode Roundup: BRK.B, AAPL, COST, V, AXP Podcast@Zacks.com Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks. Almost a year ago, Wall Street learned that Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) was selling lots of shares of its largest equity holding, Apple. Apple is one of the \"4 pillars\" of Berkshire Hathaway and a key component of the business. At the May 2024 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett said they were selling for tax reasons. But the selling of the shares continued. As of the third quarter of 2024, Berkshire had sold 100 million shares. It now owns just 300 million. Apple is now just 26.2% of the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio, down from around 50%. There are three important lessons value investors can learn from Buffett\\'s sale of Apple shares. 1. Buy and hold forever is a myth 2. Don\\'t fall in love with your stocks 3. You can\\'t market time Valuations: Does It Matter? 1. Apple Inc. AAPL When Berkshire Hathaway bought Apple in the first quarter of 2016, it was cheap on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis. It had a P/E under 15, which usually indicates a company is a value. But Apple is now trading with a forward P/E of 32.3%. And Apple has a PEG ratio, which measures the P/E divided by growth, of 2.4. A PEG ratio under 1.0 indicates a company has both value and growth. But Apple is more expensive. Will we ever really find out why Buffett decided to start selling Apple in 2024? 2. American Express Co. AXP American Express is now Berkshire Hathaway\\'s second largest holding in its equity portfolio. It makes up 15.4% of the portfolio. Shares of American Express have been on a tear the last year, adding 47%. Yet American Express still has attractive valuations. It trades with a forward P/E of 20 and has a PEG ratio of 1.5. Is this a buying opportunity in American Express? 3. Visa Inc. V Story Continues Visa is also a holding in the Berkshire Hathaway equity portfolio. Buffett bought it in 2011 and has never sold, or bought, more shares even as valuations soared in 2020 and 2021. Visa traded over 40x during the pandemic. It was a small position originally, and remains so, even though the shares were up 27.8% over the last year. Yet, Visa is still trading with a forward P/E of 31. That is \"cheaper\" than Apple but it\\'s too high to be considered a classic value stock. Should investors follow Berkshire Hathaway into Visa in 2025? 4. The Coca-Cola Co. KO Coca-Cola has been part of Berkshire Hathaway\\'s portfolio for decades. It remains one of the largest positions in the equity portfolio, at 10.8%. Shares of Coke are up 16.9% over the last year. It\\'s not cheap, with a forward P/E of 23.5. Coca-Cola also has a PEG ratio of 3.8. A PEG under 1.0 indicates growth and value. Is Coca-Cola still a buy in 2025?

Shares of computer processor maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jumped 10.5% in the afternoon session after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is in talks with Broadcom and TSMC to sell certain assets. Sources revealed Broadcom is interested in Intel\\'s product business, while TSMC is more focused on snapping up and controlling some of its factories. Investors are betting on management to make a move to unlock value in some of its operating segments, given the significant investments that have been made in recent years. The stock\\'s reaction suggests the market sees real potential in a deal with industry peers like Broadcom and TSMC, both leaders in chip design and manufacturing. Is now the time to buy Intel? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free. What The Market Is Telling Us Intel’s shares are very volatile and have had 23 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Intel and indicate this news significantly impacted the market’s perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 8.7% on the news that Vice President JD Vance announced at the AI Action Summit in Paris that the US will provide regulatory measures to protect the country\\'s artificial intelligence technologies from \"theft and misuse.\" The global AI race is intensifying across industries, but few are as critical as semiconductors, where AI-powered chips run smart data centers, large language models like ChatGPT, and self-driving cars. Intel has recently won government grants to build facilities to manufacture cutting-edge semiconductor chips on US soil in the coming years, a move that could help improve the company\\'s competitiveness. The Vice President\\'s comments suggest Intel and other US innovators could benefit from measures that help protect valuable intellectual property, especially in artificial intelligence, ensuring their innovations drive sales and expand market share both domestically and internationally. Intel is up 28.8% since the beginning of the year, but at $26.04 per share, it is still trading 43.6% below its 52-week high of $46.15 from March 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Intel’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $393.76. Today’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with DEXSF. Over the previous year, the firm has seen market share losses to Huawei. Wedbush, however, hopes Apple's AI-driven developmentsalong with forthcoming iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 introductionswill assist to restore ground lost. Analyst Dan Ives sees Apple Intelligence as a main driver of iPhone upgrades, especially in areas where the technology has already been launched. China should have the AI capability by April or May. Wedbush projects that ultimately 25% of the world's population will access artificial intelligence via an Apple device. Apple is hoping to stimulate expansion in China by creating an ecosystem of AI-powered apps grounded on Apple Intelligence. The project is supposed to generate fresh income and propel customer improvements. With a 1% year-over-year drop in iPhone income for the past quarter$69.14 billionApple fell short of the $71.04 billion expectation. Greater China's revenue also fell to $18.51 billion. China still presents a hurdle for Apple, but Wedbush notes simpler year-over-year comparisons and expects development to start in the area from the June quarter forward. Based on the Alibaba AI alliance, Wedbush thinks Apple CEO Tim Cook has properly handled the company's strategy in China despite continuous geopolitical concerns between the U.S. and China.

Wedbush, however, hopes Apple's AI-driven developmentsalong with forthcoming iPhone 16 and iPhone 17 introductionswill assist to restore ground lost. Analyst Dan Ives sees Apple Intelligence as a main driver of iPhone upgrades, especially in areas where the technology has already been launched. China should have the AI capability by April or May.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The market is experiencing a period of high returns, with two consecutive years of around 25% returns and 15 years of mid-teens returns, prompting investors to be cautious. The average stock market return is around 9-10% per year, historically, based on corporate earnings growth and dividends and buybacks. The 20 companies the fund owns are well-positioned and expected to perform well. Against this backdrop, in the fourth quarter, the fund returned -0.98% compared to 2.41% return for the S&P 500. In addition, you can check the fund’s top 5 holdings to determine its best picks for 2024. In its fourth quarter 2024 investor letter, Bretton Fund emphasized stocks such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).

            "**Earnings and Outlook:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   Nvidia is expected to modestly beat earnings expectations for its fiscal Q4 results, which will be reported on February 26.\n",
            "*   However, the company's first-quarter outlook may face challenges due to the transition to Blackwell chips, a potential decline in Hopper chip demand, and ongoing restrictions in China.\n",
            "*   Despite near-term pressures, Bank of America remains optimistic about Nvidia's long-term potential, considering it a computing platform rather than just a chipmaker.\n",
            "*   Analysts estimate 73% revenue growth, and there is a strong track record of exceeding expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Stock Performance and Valuation:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   Nvidia's stock has recently climbed, clearing a key resistance level, and is approaching levels seen before concerns about DeepSeek emerged.\n",
            "*   An AI sell-off had briefly brought the stock down, but it's recovering.\n",
            "*   Nvidia's valuation is considered attractive by some, trading at 31x projected 2025 earnings and 24x for 2026, which is on the lower end of its historical range.\n",
            "*   Compared to other big tech companies, Nvidia's forward earnings perspective is cheaper than Apple's and Microsoft's.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Upcoming Catalysts and Developments:**\n",
            "\n",

            "*   The South Korean government plans to buy 10,000 graphic processing units to build an artificial intelligence computing center lifted shares.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Strategic Moves:**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   Nvidia has reduced its stake in Arm Holdings by 44%. This may be related to Arm's plans to compete directly with its customers, including Nvidia, by designing and selling its own processors.\n",
            "*   Nvidia has unveiled a new stake in China-based WeRide, a client that uses Nvidia's software and GPUs for autonomous vehicles, and Nebius Group, an AI-focused tech group.\n",

            "*   The market is anticipating another peak in AI hardware spending in 2025, with major companies like Meta and Alphabet planning significant capital expenditures on AI hardware.\n",
            "*   Bank of America's global fund manager survey indicates that fund managers are moving away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks (including Nvidia) and focusing more on global equities, gold, and small-cap US stocks.\n",

            "*   **AI Focus:** Microsoft is heavily focused on integrating AI across its products, which is expected to increase demand for its offerings, particularly its Azure cloud services. CFO Amy Hood anticipates continued revenue growth driven by Azure and AI services.\n",
            "*   **Analyst Ratings:** RBC Capital Markets reiterated an \"Outperform\" rating with a $500 price target, citing Microsoft's diverse market exposure, large installed base, and position to capitalize on generative AI.\n",
            "*   **Valuation:** One analysis suggests that Microsoft is fairly valued based on a Discounted Earnings model, while another valuation using free cash flow indicates it may be overvalued.\n",
            "*   **Board Changes:** Rashida Hodge, Corporate VP of Customer Success - Azure Data and AI at Microsoft, was appointed to Regal Rexnord Corporation's Board of Directors.\n",
            "*   **Market Sentiment:** Fund managers are starting to move away from the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, including Microsoft, and are focusing on global equities and small-cap stocks.\n",

            "*   **New ETF:** Defiance ETFs launched the Battleshares TSLA vs F ETF (ELON), which aims to capitalize on the competition between Tesla and Ford. ELON takes a leveraged long position in Tesla and a short position in Ford.\n",
            "*   **ETF Strategy:** ELON ETF's performance depends on Tesla's share price outperforming Ford's. It's designed for investors bullish on Tesla and bearish on Ford but comes with higher risk and volatility due to leveraged positions.\n",

            "\n",
            "*   **AI Expansion in China:** Apple is partnering with Alibaba and considering Baidu to enhance its AI capabilities in China. This is seen as a strategy to regain market share lost to Huawei and drive iPhone upgrades through \"Apple Intelligence.\" Wedbush maintains an \"Outperform\" rating with a $325 price target, expecting AI-driven growth in China starting in the June quarter.\n",
            "*   **New Product Launch with AI and In-House Modem:** Apple is teasing a new product launch, expected around February 19, featuring \"Apple Intelligence\" and the A18 chip. This device will also be Apple's first with an in-house cellular modem chip.\n",
            "*   **AI Integration:** Apple is integrating AI across its device ecosystem and developing \"Apple Intelligence\" with specialized AI chips focused on on-device machine learning and privacy-preserving AI applications.\n",
            "*   **Stock Impact:** Analysts are overhauling Apple's stock price targets after a record Q1 earnings. Wedbush is optimistic about AI-driven developments and upcoming iPhone releases.\n",

            "*   **Q4 Earnings:** Nvidia is expected to report earnings on February 26. Analysts anticipate a slight earnings beat for fiscal Q4, but the first-quarter outlook faces pressures related to Blackwell architecture implementation, weakening Hopper-based chip sales, and China trade limitations. BofA maintains a positive view on Nvidia, rating it as a top selection in its sector.\n",
            "*   **Valuation:** Nvidia's valuation is at the lower end of its historical range.\n",
            "*   **GTC Conference:** The upcoming GTC conference on March 17 is a potential catalyst, with expected chip reveals and expansion into robotics and quantum computing.\n",

            "*   **New Product Launch with AI:** Apple is teasing a new product launch expected to feature \"Apple Intelligence\" and the A18 chip (likely for the iPhone 16). This device will also be Apple's first with an in-house cellular modem chip.\n",
            "*   **Analyst Outlook:** Wedbush maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple with a price target of $325. Morgan Stanley reaffirmed its \"Overweight\" rating and a $275 price target, anticipating a strong launch for the iPhone SE 4.\n",
            "*   **China Challenges:** Apple's iPhone revenue and revenue from Greater China both declined year-over-year in the last quarter. China continues to be a hurdle.\n",
            "*   **Stock Impact:** Apple’s push into AI, especially in China, is perceived as a positive catalyst. Wedbush believes CEO Tim Cook has handled the China strategy well, despite geopolitical concerns. The new product launch with AI features is also expected to be a driver for growth. However, concerns about slowing iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market remain.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Nvidia (NVDA)**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Dominant Position in AI Chips:** Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market with its GPUs powering major AI applications and cloud services. Their \"first-mover advantage\" and software ecosystem are considered key strengths.\n",
            "*   **Market Correction:** Nvidia experienced a significant market correction due to the emergence of China-based DeepSeek.\n",
            "*   **Stake in ARM Holdings:** Nvidia has reduced its stake in Arm Holdings by 44%. This may reflect Arm's potential move into direct competition with Nvidia, as Arm is considering designing and selling its own line of processors. However, Nvidia did unveil a new stake in China-based WeRide, an autonomous vehicles company that uses Nvidia's software. They also invested in AI-focused tech group Nebius Group. Nvidia closed out prior holdings in Soundcloud and Serve Robotics.\n",
            "*   **Earnings Expectations and Potential Risks:** Bank of America (BofA) expects Nvidia to slightly beat earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter (to be reported February 26). However, they also highlight potential challenges to the first-quarter outlook related to the transition to Blackwell chips, weakening Hopper chip sales, and China trade restrictions. Wall Street analysts are convinced that Nvidia undershot its revenue projection and estimate 73% growth on average. Management expects revenue of $37.5 billion, which would indicate 70% year-over-year growth.\n",
            "*   **Analyst Outlook:** BofA remains optimistic about Nvidia's long-term potential and maintains its \"top sector pick\" rating, emphasizing Nvidia's position as a computing platform with hardware-software integration advantages. They also note that Nvidia's valuation is at the lower end of its historical range.\n",
            "*   **Upcoming Catalysts:** The GTC conference on March 17 is seen as a major potential catalyst, with expected chip reveals and expansion announcements in robotics and quantum computing.\n",
            "*   **Stock Impact:** Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market and strong growth prospects continue to be positive drivers for its stock price. However, investors should be aware of potential near-term headwinds related to chip transitions, China trade, and increasing competition.\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, both companies are heavily involved in AI, but their approaches and challenges differ. Apple is focused on integrating AI into its devices and services, particularly in China. Nvidia is the dominant player in AI chips, but it faces increased competition and potential near-term risks related to its business transitions and geopolitical factors. Investors should weigh these factors when considering the potential impact on each company's stock price.\n",
